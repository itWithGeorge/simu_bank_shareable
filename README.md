> **Context:** The code snippets in this public repository were produced as part of a **senior Flutter developer** interview for a **Swiss private banking** company. The take‑home test included **~200 upfront evaluation criteria** across three core features—**Login**, **Transactional History**, and **Encryption**—and required adherence to a predefined **Figma** design system.

- **Scope:** Implement key banking flows (auth, transactions, secure storage/crypto) with production‑minded patterns and UX aligned to Figma.
